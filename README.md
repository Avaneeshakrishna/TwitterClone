# ðŸ›  Twitter Clone â€“ MERN Stack

A full-stack Twitter Clone built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, featuring authentication, post creation, liking, commenting, and profile management.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Twitter Clone (MERN Stack)

This project is a fully functional Twitter Clone built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It replicates key features of Twitter, including user authentication, post creation, likes, comments, profile management, and real-time notifications.
The project was developed as a learning and side project to enhance my full-stack development skills. I followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GUVz2psWUg) as a foundation but introduced several optimizations, including improved API performance, state management with React Query, and UI enhancements with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
It serves as a great reference for anyone looking to understand modern web development with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and cloud deployment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
This guide will walk you through setting up the Twitter Clone project on your local machine for development and testing. Follow the steps below to get started.
ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
âœ… Node.js (v16 or later)
âœ… MongoDB (for local database setup or MongoDB Atlas)
âœ… Git (for cloning the repository)
âœ… A package manager (either npm or yarn)

### âš¡ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avaneeshakrishna/TwitterClone.git
   cd TwitterClone
   ```

2. Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)
   ```
   cd backend
   npm init -y                            #Initialize Node.js project (if not already done)
   npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs dotenv cors cookie-parser cloudinary #Install dependencies
   npm i -D nodemon                       # Install nodemon (for development)
   npm run dev                            # Start the backend server
   ```
  MongoDB Setup (Local or Atlas)
   - If using MongoDB Atlas, update MONGO_URI in your .env file.
   - If using local MongoDB, ensure your MongoDB service is running.

  Create a JWT Secret Key
  - Run the following command in Git Bash:
    ```
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
Copy the generated key and add it to your .env file: (It may look like this)\
JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret\
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string\
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name\
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key\
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret\

3. Frontend Setup (React & Vite)
