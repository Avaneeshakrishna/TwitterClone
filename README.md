# ðŸ›  Twitter Clone â€“ MERN Stack

A full-stack Twitter Clone built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, featuring authentication, post creation, liking, commenting, and profile management.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Twitter Clone (MERN Stack)

This project is a fully functional Twitter Clone built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It replicates key features of Twitter, including user authentication, post creation, likes, comments, profile management, and real-time notifications.
The project was developed as a learning and side project to enhance my full-stack development skills. I followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GUVz2psWUg) as a foundation but introduced several optimizations, including improved API performance, state management with React Query, and UI enhancements with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
It serves as a great reference for anyone looking to understand modern web development with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and cloud deployment.
